Based on my observation, the css, html and javascript has its own part in completing the pokemon search website.

Style.css:
The CSS is responsible for visual appearance, allowing developers to style HTML elements by defining colors, fonts, layouts, and responsiveness. 

Script.js:
JavaScript, on the other hand, adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to a webpage, enabling features like animations and form validation such as the search engine.

Test.html:
While HTML builds the skeleton of a website and CSS makes it visually appealing, JavaScript brings it to life by making it interactive and functional.
